## How to get started

First you have to set up the request data.

### Registering business premise request

```C#
var bp = new BusinessPremiseRequestBody
{
    BusinessPremiseRequest = new BusinessPremiseRequest
    {
        BusinessPremise = new BusinessPremise
        {
            TaxNumber = "12345678", //must be the same as in cert
            BusinessPremiseID = "MWTEST",
            BPIdentifier = new BPIdentifier
            {
                RealEstateBP = new RealEstateBP
                {
                    PropertyID = new PropertyID
                    {
                        BuildingNumber = 123,
                        BuildingSectionNumber = 12,
                        CadastralNumber = 1234
                    },
                    Address = new Address
                    {
                        HouseNumber = "123",
                        Street = "MS",
                        Community = "LJ",
                        City = "LJ",
                        PostalCode = "1000"
                    }
                }
            },
            ValidityDate = DateTime.Now.AddYears(1),
            SoftwareSupplier = new List<SoftwareSupplier>
			{
				 new SoftwareSupplier
				{
					TaxNumber = "87654321"
				}
			}
        }
    }
};
```

...or request for registering movable business premise...

```C#
var bp = new BusinessPremiseRequestBody
{
    BusinessPremiseRequest = new BusinessPremiseRequest
    {
        BusinessPremise = new BusinessPremise
        {
            TaxNumber = "12345678", //must be the same as in cert
            BusinessPremiseID = "MWTEST",
            BPIdentifier = new BPIdentifier
            {
                PremiseType = BPIdentifier.PremiseTypeEnum.A
            },
            ValidityDate = DateTime.Now.AddYears(1),
            SoftwareSupplier = new List<SoftwareSupplier>
			{
				 new SoftwareSupplier
				{
					TaxNumber = "87654321"
				}
			}
        }
    }
};
```

### Invoice request

```C#
var inv = new InvoiceRequestBody
{
    InvoiceRequest = new InvoiceRequest
    {
        Invoice = new Invoice
        {
            TaxNumber = "10442529",
            IssueDateTime = DateTime.Now,
            NumberingStructure = NumberingStructureEnum.B,
            InvoiceIdentifier = new InvoiceIdentifier
            {
                BusinessPremiseID = "MWTEST",
                ElectronicDeviceID = "SRV1",
                InvoiceNumber = 1
            },
            InvoiceAmount = 60.01M,
            PaymentAmount = 80.00M,
            TaxesPerSeller = new List<TaxesPerSeller>
            {
                new TaxesPerSeller
                {
                    VAT = new List<VAT>
                    {
                        new VAT
                        {
                            TaxRate = 22.00M,
                            TaxableAmount = 60.00M,
                            TaxAmount = 20.00M
                        }
                    }
                }
            },
            OperatorTaxNumber = "10442529"
        }
    }
};
```

...or sales book invoice request...

```C#
var inv = new InvoiceRequestBody
{
    InvoiceRequest = new InvoiceRequest
    {
        SalesBookInvoice = new SalesBookInvoice
        {
            TaxNumber = "10442529",
            IssueDate = DateTime.Now,
            SalesBookIdentifier = new SalesBookIdentifier
            {
                InvoiceNumber = "612",
                SetNumber = "03",
                SerialNumber = "5001-0001018"
            },
            BusinessPremiseID = "MWTEST",
            InvoiceAmount = 1234.56M,
            ReturnsAmount = 12.30M,
            PaymentAmount = 1047.76M,
            TaxesPerSeller = new List<TaxesPerSeller>
            {
                new TaxesPerSeller
                {
                    VAT = new List<.VAT>
                    {
                        new VAT
                        {
                            TaxRate = 22.00M,
                            TaxableAmount = 36.89M,
                            TaxAmount = 8.12M
                        },
                        new VAT
                        {
                            TaxRate = 9.50M,
                            TaxableAmount = 56.53M,
                            TaxAmount = 5.37M
                        }
                    },
                    OtherTaxesAmount = 53.89M
                },
                new TaxesPerSeller
                {
                    SellerTaxNumber = "82730341",
                    VAT = new List<VAT>
                    {
                        new VAT
                        {
                            TaxRate = 22.00M,
                            TaxableAmount = 36.89M,
                            TaxAmount = 8.12M
                        },
                        new VAT
                        {
                            TaxRate = 9.50M,
                            TaxableAmount = 56.53M,
                            TaxAmount = 5.37M
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
```

When building request object note that all properties are documented from the offcial documentation.
Intelisense should provide additional explanation of what each property is used for.

A request is first validated before it is send to ensure the correctness of the data.
However, it is still strongly advised that the official documentation is read.

## Sending the request

Client is set up this way:

```C#
var c = new FursConfig 
{ 
  Url = "https://blagajne-test.fu.gov.si:9002/v1/cash_registers", //test or production url given by Furs 
  Certificate = cert //X509Certificate2 object which holds the certificate
};
//initializing the client
var client = new XmlFursWebService(c);
```

Sending business premise request is done like this:
```C#
var bpResponse = await client.SendRequest<BusinessPremiseResponseBody>(bpRequest);

//checking if an error occured
if( bpResponse.IsErrorResponse() ){
  throw new Exception(bpResponse.BusinessPremiseResponse.Error.ErrorMessage);
}
```
Sending invoice request is very similar:
```C#
var invResponse = await client.SendRequest<InvoiceResponseBody>(invRequest);

//checking if an error occured
if( invResponse.IsErrorResponse() ){
  throw new Exception(invResponse.InvoiceResponse.Error.ErrorMessage);
}

//getting UniqueInvoiceID or EOR
string eor = invResponse.InvoiceResponse.UniqueInvoiceID;

//getting ZOI - only if it is invoice request ( but not sales book invoice request )
//ZOI is automatically calculated before the request is sent
string zoi = bpRequest.InvoiceRequest.Invoice.ProtectedID;

//generating QR code
//note that namespace using MadWare.Furs.Extensions; must be added
string qrCode = bpRequest.InvoiceRequest.Invoice.GenerateQRCode();
```

#### Events flow

The *SendRequest* method provides an optional parameter of type *IFursFlowControl*.
```C#
public interface IFursFlowControl<TRequest, TResponse> where TRequest : BaseRequestBody
													   where TResponse : BaseResponseBody
{
	Task OnRequestPayloadSerialized(string requestPayload, TRequest requestBody);

	Task OnRequestPayloadSigned(string signedRequestPayload, TRequest requestBody);

	Task OnSuccessfulResponse(string responsePayload, TResponse responseBody);

	Task OnErrorResponse(string responsePayload, TResponse responseBody);
}
```
Instead of getting response from the *SendRequest* method itself, you can create your
own class and implement *IFursFlowControl*. This allows you to have more detailed access to
the sending process instead of just receiving the reponse. 
Useful when you have a class that handles invoice database storage, invoice emailing, etc..
and you want all your logic to be in one place.

## To-Do

* Write more and better unit tests
* Make better documentation and examples
* Add some sort of helpers for common requests like basic invoices etc...
* Add support for ASP.NET Core
* Add support for Json version(?)

All contributors are welcome.
