# MadWare.Furs
C# library for simplified communication with FURS (Finanƒçna uprava Republike Slovenije).

## How to get started

First you have to set up the request data.

### Registering business premise request

```C#
var bp = new BusinessPremiseRequestBody
{
    BusinessPremiseRequest = new BusinessPremiseRequest
    {
        Header = new Header
        {
            MessageID = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
            DateTime = DateTime.Now
        },
        BusinessPremise = new BusinessPremise
        {
            TaxNumber = "12345678", //must be the same as in cert
            BusinessPremiseID = "MWTEST",
            BPIdentifier = new BPIdentifier
            {
                RealEstateBP = new RealEstateBP
                {
                    PropertyID = new PropertyID
                    {
                        BuildingNumber = 123,
                        BuildingSectionNumber = 12,
                        CadastralNumber = 1234
                    },
                    Address = new Address
                    {
                        HouseNumber = "123",
                        Street = "MS",
                        Community = "LJ",
                        City = "LJ",
                        PostalCode = "1000"
                    }
                }
            },
            ValidityDate = DateTime.Now.AddYears(1),
            SoftwareSupplier = new SoftwareSupplier
            {
                TaxNumber = "87654321"
            }
        }
    }
};
```

...or request for registering movable business premise...

```C#
var bp = new BusinessPremiseRequestBody
{
    BusinessPremiseRequest = new BusinessPremiseRequest
    {
        Header = new Header
        {
            MessageID = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
            DateTime = DateTime.Now
        },
        BusinessPremise = new BusinessPremise
        {
            TaxNumber = "12345678", //must be the same as in cert
            BusinessPremiseID = "MWTEST",
            BPIdentifier = new BPIdentifier
            {
                PremiseType = BPIdentifier.PremiseTypeEnum.A
            },
            ValidityDate = DateTime.Now.AddYears(1),
            SoftwareSupplier = new SoftwareSupplier
            {
                TaxNumber = "87654321"
            }
        }
    }
};
```

```C#
var inv = new InvoiceRequestBody
{
    InvoiceRequest = new InvoiceRequest
    {
        Header = new Header
        {
            MessageID = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
            DateTime = DateTime.Now
        },
        Invoice = new Invoice

                    VAT = new List<.VAT>
                    {
                        new Invoice.VAT
                        {

                        },
                        new Models.Invoice.VAT
                        {
                            TaxRate = 9.50M,

                            TaxAmount = 5.37M
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
```

When building request object note that all properties are documented from the offcial documentation.
Intelisense should provide additional explanation of what each property is used for.

A request is first validated before it is send to ensure the correctness of the data.
However, it is still strongly advised that the official documentation is read.

## Sending the request

Client is set up this way:

```C#
var c = new FursConfig 
{ 
  Url = url, //test or production url given by Furs 
  Certificate = cert //X509Certificate2 object which holds the certificate
};
//initializing the client
var client = new XmlFursWebService(c);
```

Sending business premise request is done like this:
```C#
var bpResponse = await client.SendRequest<BusinessPremiseResponseBody>(bpRequest);

//checking if an error occured
if( bpResponse.IsErrorResponse() ){
  throw new Exception(bpResponse.BusinessPremiseResponse.Error.ErrorMessage);
}
```
Sending invoice request is very similar:
```C#
var invResponse = await client.SendRequest<InvoiceResponseBody>(invRequest);

//checking if an error occured
if( invResponse.IsErrorResponse() ){
  throw new Exception(invResponse.InvoiceResponse.Error.ErrorMessage);
}

//getting UniqueInvoiceID or EOR
string eor = invResponse.InvoiceResponse.UniqueInvoiceID;

//getting ZOI - only if it is invoice request ( but not sales book invoice request )
string zoi = bpRequest.InvoiceRequest.Invoice.ProtectedID;
```

## To-Do

* the library is currently in beta thus it should and will be extensively tested before version 1.0.0 is released.
* Adding support for QRCode generation
* Write more and better unit tests
* Make better documentation and examples

All contributors are welcome.
